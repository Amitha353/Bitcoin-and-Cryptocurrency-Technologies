1.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions
---------------------------------
* Cryptographic Hash function - mathematical function and takes three attributes:
  a. takes any string as input;
  b. fixed-size output (could be 256 bits - like bitcoins);
  c. efficiently computable (within a reasonable length of time it needs to be computed);

* Hash functions need to be cryptographically secure (Security properties):
  a. Collision-free
  -------------------
    It can be assumed that the hash function is collision free, since collision occurence is infinitesimal.
    If x != y , then we can assume H(x) != H(Y);
    In case H(X) = H(Y), then assume X = Y;(message digest);
    In Reality (Input) # (X | Y) is much greater than (Output) # Hash function - It means there is a chance for collision to occur, but it occurs when 2^130 or more possibilities are taken into consideration and computation effort is a lot.
    Therefore it is safe to assume that hash-functions are collision free.
    
  b. Hiding

  c. Puzzle-friendly 
  -------------------

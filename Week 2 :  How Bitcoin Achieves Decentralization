2.1 Centralization vs Decentralization
---------------------------------------
- Almost no system is purely decentralized or centralized.
- Example : Email - follows the SMTP (Simple Mail transfer Protocol) - decentralized protocol, but dominated by centralized webmail services.

* Aspects of decentralization in Bitcoin:
1. Who maintains the ledger?
2. Who has authority over which transactions are valid?
3. Who creates new bitcoins?
4. Who determines how the rules of the system change?
5. How do bitcoins acquire exchange value?

* Beyond the protocol : exchanges, wallet softwares, service providers, etc

* Three aspects of bitcoins and where they fal on the centralization and decentralization spectrum:
1. Peer-to-peer network : (closest to decentralization) 
    - open to anyone, 
    - low barrier entry. 
    - Anybody can run a bitcoin node - download the software and run it.
2. Mining : (Not very decentralized)
    - open to anyone.
    - but requires a very high capital cost
    - inevitable concentration of power
    - undesirable;
 3. Updates to softwares: (Not purely decentralized)
    (Coenceptually anybody can look into the specifications and develop their own bitcoin node, but practically doesn't work so.)
    - Core developers trusted by the community work on the softwares;
    - Developers have great power;

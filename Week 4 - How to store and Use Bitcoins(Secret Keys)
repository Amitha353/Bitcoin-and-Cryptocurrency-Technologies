4.1 Simple Local Storage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> It is the simplest way to store bitcoins bu putting it into a local device.
-> To spend a Bitcoin, need certain information:
  a. Information from the public blockchain.
  b. The owners secret signing key.
  
-> The information from the blockchain is publically avaiable, and hence can be gathered any any time, but it is essential to keep track of the owners seecret signing key.
-> Therefore storage of Bitcoins mostly deals with key management(secret key management).

* Goals  - Bitcoin storage and Usage
------------------------------------
1. Availability - You can spend your coins.
2. Security - Nobody else can spend your coins.
3. Convience - easy to use.

* Simplest Approach - Managing keys
-----------------------------
-> Take the key, and store the key in a file on your computer or phone.

Evaluating this method against the goals.
1. Availability -> As a available as the device. (If the device is lost/wiped -> key is lost and coin is lost);
2. Security -> As secure as the device. Device compromised -> key leaked -> coins stolen.
3. Very convenient.

* Wallet software
------------------
-> Keeps track of coins, provides nice user interface.
-> Nice trick : use separate address/key for each coic.
  - benefits privacy (looks like separate owners - provides ananymity/privacy)
  - wallet can do the bookkeeping, user needn't know.
 
* Encoding Address 
--------------------
-> Payments are made via exchanging address. The address needs to be encoded or conveyed to make a transaction possible.
-> Addresses are exchanged in 2 manners:
  a. Encoded as text string: base58 notation. -> The key is taken and encoded in base58 notation. Then 58 characters are used to encode digits in base 58 notation. Here likely looking characters and numbers are excluded (O,0);
  b. QR (Quick Response) code -> 2D barcode, Phone can scan the 2D barcode and extract the bits of the address.

Q. What is a Bitcoin wallet?

a. An address that contains a lot of unspent bitcoins
b. A piece of software that remembers an individual's Bitcoin addresses and keys - true.
c. A type of mining software
d. An online exchange that people can go to in order to acquire bitcoins

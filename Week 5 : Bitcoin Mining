5.1 : The task of Bitcoin Miners
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Mining Bitcoins in 6 easy steps
----------------------------------
(How to become a Miner)

1. Join the network, (become a Bitcoin node), listen for transactions.
    - Validate all proposed transactions.
2. Listen for new blocks, maintain block chain.
    - When a new block is proposed, validate it.
3. Assemble a new valid block.
4. Find the nonce to make your block valid. (Hard - computationally).
5. Hope everybody accepts your new block.
6. Profit! (>25 BTC / block -> $15,000).

* Finding a valid block
----------------------
-> Two main hash-based data structures.
  1. block-chain - each block's header points to the previous block header in the chain.
  2. Merkel tree within each block - hash-based binary tree of all the transactions included within that block.

# Miners assembly all the transactions from the pending pool into the tree.
# Create a block with the right header that points to the previous block.
# Then need to start searching over the nonce field to try to have the hash of the block headers start with the required number of zeroes.
# Can start with a nonce of all 0's (32-bit) - get an incorrect hash; Keep trying of other nonces (nonce 1 -> hash, etc);
# Can try every single possiblity for the 32-bit nonce, you may not get the right hash, need to make further changes.

# Parameter in the coinbase transaction - where the miners are minting new coins and claiming it.
# There is an "extra nonce" parameter in the coin-base, after exhausting all possible nonces in the block-header, then the extra-nonce is used.
# The extra nonces in the coinbase transaction will be incremented and the hash of it will be computed, and will start searching the block-header.
   **** Changing a single parameter in the coinbase transaction, will require the entire merkel tree of transaction to change.
   - Changing the extra nonce in the coinbase transaction is expensive than changing the nonce in the header, hence use the outer-loop. 
    - outer loop - changes nonce in the coin-base parameter
    - inner loop - changes nonce in the block header.
 # Difficult computation, but eventually will find the right combination between the extra nonce in the coinbase transaction and the nonce in the header.
 # Will find a block with a hash with sufficient 0's to make it valid -> published and announce and profit.

6.1 Anonymity Basics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Anonymous = without a name.
-> Bitcoin addresses are public key hashes rather than real identities.
-> computer scientist call this "pseudonymity".

* Anonymity in computer science
---------------------------------
-> Anonymity = pseudonymity + unlinkability;

-> unlinkability - Different interactions of the same user with the system should not be linked with each other.

Pseudonymity vs anonymity in forums
------------------------------------
-> Reddit - pick a long-term pseudonym. (Pseudonymity)
-> 4Chan - make posts with no attribution at all. (Anonymity)

# With Pseudonomity profile -> easy to link back together to your real identity.

* Why is unlinkability needed?
------------------------------
1. Many Bitcoin services require real identity.
2. Linked profiles can be deanonymized by a variety of side channels.

* Defining unlinkability in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------
-> Hard to link different address to same users.
-> Hard to link different transactions of the same user.
-> Harder to link sender of a payment to its recipient.

* Quantifying anonymity
------------------------
-> Complete unlinkability (among "all" addresses/transactions) is hard.

-> Anonymity set : measurement parameter - the set of all transactions that are hidden. The crowd that one attempts to blend into.

-> To calculate anonymity set:
  - define adversary model.
  - reason carefully about: what the adversary knows, doesn't know, and cannot know.

* Why anonymous cryptocurrencies?
------------------------------------
-> Block chain based currencies are totally publicly, and permanently traceable.
-> Without anonymity, privacy is much worse than traditional banking!

* What about money laundering?
-------------------------------
-> Legitimate worry.
-> Bottleneck: moving large flows into and out of Bitcoin ("cashing out") - hard. (BTC -> money ($))

* Anonymous e-cash : history
------------------------------
- David Chaum, 1982
- Blind signatures - Two-party protocol to create digital signature without signer knowing the input.

# Consider a Bank with a protocol for Anonymous e-cash through blind signatures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Consider there is a Bank and it stores various things in its database. It stores two tables.
  -> Table 1 : Mapping between usera and their account balance.
  -> Table 2 : Spent coins.
2. Suppose a user wants to withdraw an anonymous coins from the system.
  - User wishes to withdraw an anonymous coin of standard denomination.
3. In response to the User's request the bank is gonna deduct the amount required my the user in the "Spent coins" table.
4. Then the bank and the user are gonna execute a "two party" protocol. (Blind) signature protocol.
  - The user picks a random serial number of a coin.
  - At the end the user receives a signature of the serial number, but the banks is unaware of the users's serial number.
  - This signed number represents an anonymous token. 
5. In can the current user wants to make payment to another user, then current user sends to the next user the "signed token" and the "plain text value of the token/serial number".
6. The receiving user will immediately contact the bank and try to deposit the anonymous coin. (Inorder to verify - no double spends, etc)
8. Tha bank gets the message to deposit the coin and also receives the "plain text" and "signature". 
  - It verifies the signature is valid.
  - It also verifies the serial number that it received is not in the list of "spent coins". (double spend attack check); 
  - It then puts the serial number in the spent coins table so that no doble-spends can occur.
  - It then adds the amount to next user's account and sends a message to the next user.
  (Since the bank din't see the serial number initially, the bank doesn't know who is the owner of the coin);
7. On verification of the next coin the next user will allow the completion of the transaction.

**** Bank cannot link the two users.

* Drawbacks
--------------
Depends on trusting the bank.
